# Variables in GO

`var` is used to declare a variable in GO
We can decalare multiple variables at once
eg: ```var a, b int = 1,2```

Variables without a declaration will have are initialized with
`zero-valued` for `int` its `0`

`:=` is used to declare and initialize a variable
eg `name:="afkcodes"`

NOTE: `:=` syntax is only available inside functions
